## Javascript Data Structure and Algorithm

I started this project while learning **Data Structures and Algorithms** using Javascript and though of putting it out as a website for others to use it and interact with it to try themselves how the code is working.
Below mentioned is the list of programs written.

- Stacks
- Sets
- Queues & Priority Queues
- Binary Search Tree
- Binary Search Tree: Traversal & Height
- Hash Tables
- Linked List
- Heap (max and min)
- Heap visualization
- Graphs: adjacency list, adjacency matrix, incidence matrix
- Graphs: breadth-first search


Special thanks to [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) for putting out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2CEgPsws3U). It helped a lot.
