## Javascript Data Structure and Algorithm

I started this project while learning **Data Structures and Algorithms** using Javascript and though of putting it out as a website for others to use it and interact with it to try themselves how the code is working.
Below mentioned is the list of programs written.

- Stacks
- Sets
- Queues & Priority Queues
- Binary Search Tree
- Binary Search Tree: Traversal & Height
- Hash Tables
- Linked List
- Heap (max and min)
- Graphs: breadth-first search

#Getting Started
Click on any link, check the code, right click to inspect element and write commands in **Console**.
