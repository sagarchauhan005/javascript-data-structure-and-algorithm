            <p>By definition, a heap is a specialized tree data structure that supports a heap property. A heap property is
                defined in such a way that the root of a heap structure will be either smaller or larger than its child nodes.
                If the parent node is greater than the child nodes, then it is known as max-heap and if the parent node is
                smaller than the child nodes then it is known as min-heap</p>
            <p>Below mentioned is the list of methods written.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enqueue: add a queue</li>
                <li>Dequeue: remove a queue</li>
                <li>Latest: returns latest active queue</li>
                <li>Size: returns size of the queue</li>
                <li>isEmpty: checks if the queue is empty or not</li>
            </ul>
